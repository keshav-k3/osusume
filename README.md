# Osusume

### Project Overview

**Osusume** is a modern, minimalist web app designed to recommend the best local food spots based on what users feel like eating. The app aims to strip away the noise of clunky restaurant directories and focus purely on **personalized food discovery** — simple, aesthetic, and community-driven.

### Core Concept

The app's mission is to be a **food lover's diary** — not just another search engine or reservation service. Users should be able to quickly discover **curated, quality food recommendations** without the hassle of forced reviews or overwhelming search filters.

### Key Features

- **What Are You Craving?** — Users select what type of food they want (Ramen, Sushi, Café, etc.) via cute icons.
- **Instant Recommendations** — Top 3-5 places suggested without overwhelming the user.
- **Google Maps + Instagram Links** — Connect users to the restaurant's location and trending social media posts.
- **Bookmark Collections** — Users can create personal collections like _"Best Curry Spots"_ or _"Late Night Eats"_.
- **One-Tap Osusume** — Simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down voting system instead of long reviews.
- **Trending Now** — Automatic list of Instagram-trending food spots.
